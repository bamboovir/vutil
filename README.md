# vutil

vutil is a util collection of fake implementations for {
    os config access, 
    environments, 
    virtual file system, 
    process processor, 
    HTTP requests
}. 

In short, this library can help you complete some occasions that must be generated by generating mock objects. 
Of course, in fact, this is just an abstraction layer that actually reduces the running speed of your program. 

Still under construction.
